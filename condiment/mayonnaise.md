# Mayonnaise

> 20 minutes from start to finish.

[Original recipe][original] by Alton Brown is no longer available. [A different
recipe][replacement] is not as good.

## Ingredients

- 1 egg yolk
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- 2 pinches sugar
- 2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 2.8 dl oil, safflower or corn

## Instructions

0. In a glass bowl, whisk together egg yolk and dry ingredients.
0. Combine lemon juice and vinegar in a separate bowl, then thoroughly whisk
   half into the yolk mixture.
0. Start whisking briskly, then start adding the oil a few drops at a time
   until the liquid seems to thicken and lighten a bit (which means you've got
   an emulsion on your hands). Once you reach that point you can relax your arm
   a little (but just a little) and increase the oil flow to a constant (albeit
   thin) stream.
0. Once half of the oil is in add the rest of the lemon juice mixture.
0. Continue whisking until all of the oil is incorporated. Leave at room
   temperature for 1 to 2 hours then refrigerate for up to 1 week.

## Notes

- I rarely have dry mustard and use Dijon instead.
- I am not convinced that the juice and vinegar mix needs to be added in two
  turns but I am also not willing to experiment...
- Mix in a minced garlic clove or two for aioli.
