1. Leave the dough to raise in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably
   overnight for added flavour.
1. Fold the dough repeatedly.
1. Divide the dough in 20 rolls of 95g each.
1. Place the rolls on parchment paper on baking trays.

## Notes

* The rye flour adds flavouring. Substitute wheat flour for a more neutral
  profile.
* Manitoba flour is a high gluten flour. You can substitute other high gluten
  flours. All-purpose flour will yield perfectly edible rolls but with
  a blander crust.
