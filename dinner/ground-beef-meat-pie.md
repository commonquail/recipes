> 3 hours 40 minutes from start to finish.

* [Original recipe][original] by Sam

## Ingredients

- 1 dl butter
- 200 g onions
- 2 tbsp garlic
- 500 g ground beef
- 300 g potatoes
- 300 g carrots
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 80 g breadcrumbs
- 2 &#8960; 30 cm pie dough
- 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash

## Instructions

### Meat filling

1. Chop onions finely.
1. Mince garlic.
1. Peel and grate potatoes and carrots.
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium high heat until it starts to
   sizzle.
1. Saut√© onions
1. Add ground beef.
1. Cook for about 5 minutes until the meat is browned.
1. Add garlic.

### Pie

1. Preheat oven to 200&deg;C convection.
1. Oil a &#8960; 23 cm pie pan.
1. Transfer the first dough disc to the pie pan and gently press down to form
   into the bottom pie crust. Transfer the meat filling from the skillet and
   spread evenly across the pie bottom with a spatula.
1. Place the second dough disc over the filling as the top pie crust. Cover the
   pie pan entirely. Gently press the edges of the top and bottom crusts
   together, then crimp with your fingers to seal. Cut 5-6 slits on the top pie
   crust for ventilation.
1. Gently brush the egg wash over the top crust and edges.
1. If the oven is not yet ready, store the assembled pie in the fridge to
   prevent the pie crust from disintegrating.
1. Bake the pie for 20 minutes, until the edges of the pie crust turn golden
   brown.
1. Reduce heat to 175&deg;C and bake for another 40 minutes, until the rest of
   the top crust is golden brown.
1. Remove the pie pan from the oven and let it cool at room temperature for at
   least 30 minutes. Serve warm.

## Notes

- You can make the pie crust or buy pie bottoms.
- I use a &#8960;25 cm &times; 3 cm pan, internal measurements.
- The pan's dimensions play an important role in final yield and serving size.
- This portion size is somewhat awkward. I find that approximately two thirds
  of 1 portion yields 1 pie of 4 slices, so 2 portions yield 3 pies.
- The skillet must be large enough to fit the ingredients and stir comfortably.
  Large surface area is convenient for stirring but total volume is most
  important.
- Total cooking time is about 2 hours 10 minutes: 40 minutes for the filling,
  1 hour 30 minutes for assembly and baking. The rest is wait time that is
  difficult to skip. It is helpful to make the filling a day in advance.
