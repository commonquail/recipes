* [Original recipe][original] by Sam

## Ingredients

- 1 dl butter
- 200 g onions
- 2 tbsp garlic
- 1 tbsp parsley
- 500 g ground beef
- 300 g potatoes
- 300 g carrots
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 80 g Panko breadcrumbs
- &#8960; 23 cm double crust pie dough
- 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash

## Instructions

### Meat filling

1. Chop onions finely.
1. Chop parsley finely.
1. Mince garlic.
1. Peel and grate potatoes and carrots.
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium high heat until it starts to
   sizzle.
1. Add onions, garlic, parsley, and ground beef.
1. Cook for about 5 minutes until the meat is browned.

### Pie

1. Preheat oven to 200&deg;C convection.
1. Transfer the first dough disc onto a &#8960; 23 cm pie pan and gently press
   down to form into the bottom pie crust. Transfer the meat filling from the
   skillet and spread evenly across the pie bottom with a spatula.
1. Place the second dough disc over the filling as the top pie crust. Cover the
   pie pan entirely. Gently press the edges of the top and bottom crusts
   together, then crimp with your fingers to seal. Cut 5-6 slits on the top pie
   crust for ventilation.
1. Gently brush the egg wash over the top crust and edges.
1. If the oven is not yet ready, store the assembled pie in the fridge to
   prevent the pie crust from disintegrating.
1. Bake the pie for 20 minutes, until the edges of the pie crust turn golden
   brown.
1. Reduce heat to 175&deg;C and bake for another 40 minutes, until the rest of
   the top crust is golden brown.
1. Remove the pie pan from the oven and let it cool at room temperature for at
   least 1 hour. Serve warm.
