### Meat sauce

0. Add and sauté beef.
0. Add coarsely grained carrot, finely chopped celery, pressed garlic, oregano,
   thyme, salt, tomato paste, and beef broth. Cook for 20 minutes.

### Bechamelsauce

0. Melt margarine in a pot at low-medium heat and stir in flour.

   till all the milk has been added and the sauce begins to boil.
0. Add salt, nutmeg, and cheese, then boil for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring
   frequently.

### Lasagna

0. Wet the bottom of an oven proof rectangular dish with the bechamelsauce.
0. Cover the bottom with a layer of lasagna plates.
0. Cover the plates with meat sauce.
0. Repeat steps 1-3 until out of sauce.

## Notes

- Frankly, this recipe is only passingly good. The result has a mild, nearly
  tame flavour.
- If you have the time, cook the meat sauce for 2 hours or more for richer
  flavour.
- Leave the lasagna for 15-20 minutes before baking to make it more sturdy.
