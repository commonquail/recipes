[Original recipe][original] by Louiogbearnaisen

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 50 g yeast
- 3 dl milk
- 3 eggs
- 100 g soft butter
- 100 g sugar
- Grains from ½ vanilla fruit
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 1 tbsp cardamom
- ½ tbsp salt
- 700-900 g wheat flour (varies a lot)
- Egg wash of 1 egg
- 300 g powdered sugar for frosting (only as needed)

### Remonce

* 250 g butter
* 100 g sugar
* 150 g brown sugar (muscovado)
* 3 tbsp cinnamon

## Instructions

### Remonce

Make the remonce while the dough raises for the first time, but if you don't
have a microwave oven, first take the butter out of the refrigerator so it can
soften in the meantime.

0. Leave the butter outside to soften, or heat it in a microwave oven for 10-15
   seconds.
0. Mix butter, sugar, and cinnamon into a homogeneous mass.

### Dough

0. Warm the milk, pour it in a large bowl, and dissolve the yeast in it.
0. Add egg, sugar, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt, and stir
   everything together.
0. Add flour little by little, kneading the dough smooth and flexible. It
   should be mildly sticky to not turn stale.
0. Cover the dough and leave it to raise for 20 minutes.

### Assembly

0. Prepare the table for rolling out dough.
0. Split the dough in two evenly sized parts.
0. With a rolling pin, roll one half into a flat rectangle of about 0.5 cm in
   height.
0. Smear half the remonce on the rectangle, covering it.
0. Tightly roll the rectangle into a Swiss roll.
0. Cut the roll into pieces approximately 3 cm thick.
0. Place the pieces on baking trays.
0. Repeat for the other part.
0. Leave to raise for another 45 minutes, covered.
0. Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C (180&deg;C convection).
0. Brush the rolls with egg wash.
0. Bake for 15 minutes; better too little than too much.

## Notes

* The more flour used, the staler the swirls end up. With only 700 g flour my
  dough was effectively batter; with 950 g flour they ended up slightly staler
  than desired.
