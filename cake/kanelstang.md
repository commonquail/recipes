## Ingredients

### Dough

* 1 dl lukewarm milk
* ¾ dl lukewarm water
* 35 g yeast
* 35 g sugar
* 4 g salt
* 4 g cardamom
* 1 egg
* 35 g butter
* ca. 400 g flour
* Egg wash of 1 egg
* Powdered sugar for frosting

### Remonce

* 200 g butter
* 200 g sugar
* 25 g cinnamon

### Optional: vanilla cream

Kanelstænger traditionally contain vanilla cream
but the addition here is optional,
and a decent powder based solution
is completely substitutable for homemade vanilla cream.

Vanilla cream makes the sticks milder, softer, and creamier,
but makes it difficult for sugar to caramelise.

* 3 egg yolks
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 vanilla bean
* ½ l milk
* 1-2 tbsp corn starch

## Instructions

### Remonce

Make the remonce while the dough raises for the first time,
but if you don't have a microwave oven,
first take the butter out of the refrigerator
so it can soften in the meantime.

0. Leave the butter outside to soften,
   or heat it in a microwave oven for 10-15 seconds.
0. Mix butter, sugar, and cinnamon into a homogeneous mass.

### Dough

0. Combine milk, water, and yeast, and stir till homogeneous.
0. Add all other ingredients and knead until the dough is firm
   and doesn't stick.
   Add more flour if necessary.
0. Cover the dough and leave it to raise in a warm place for 15 minutes.
0. Divide the dough in 4 pieces of even size.
0. One by one, roll the pieces into flat rectangles of 20 x 30 cm (W x L)
   with a rolling pin.
   The length is suggested but should fit on a baking tray.
0. Smear an even layer of remonce on each rectangle.
0. If adding vanilla cream, smear an even, not too thick, layer on each rectangle.
0. Roll the rectangles tightly into Swiss rolls.
0. Place the rolls on baking trays covered with parchment paper.
0. Flatten the rolls with your hand.
0. Cut several deep rifts, evenly spaced, in each roll
   to reveal the remonce.
0. Cover the rolls and leave to raise for 40 minutes.
0. Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C (200&deg;C convection).
0. Brush the rolls with egg wash.
0. Bake each roll for 10 to 15 minutes; better too little than too much.
0. When the kanelstænger have cooled, cover them in white frosting.

### Vanilla cream

* Make thickening from the corn starch and a little milk.
* Bring egg yolks, sugar, the rest of the milk,
  and the grains from the vanilla bean to a slow boil.
  Stir all the time.
* Add thickening little by little until satisfied with the consistency;
  the cream will thicken further as it cools.
* Boil for a couple of minutes longer. Remember to stir.
* Leave in a cold place until needed.

## Notes

* I tend to consider vanilla cream not worth the added effort.
