## Ingredients

### Dough

* 1 dl lukewarm milk
* ¾ dl lukewarm water
* 35 g yeast
* 35 g sugar
* 4 g salt
* 4 g cardamom
* 1 egg
* 35 g butter
* ca. 400 g flour
* Egg wash of 1 egg
* Powdered sugar for frosting

### Remonce

* 200 g butter
* 200 g sugar
* 25 g cinnamon

## Instructions

### Remonce

Make the remonce while the dough raises for the first time,
but if you don't have a microwave oven,
first take the butter out of the refrigerator
so it can soften in the meantime.

0. Leave the butter outside to soften,
   or heat it in a microwave oven for 10-15 seconds.
0. Mix butter, sugar, and cinnamon into a homogeneous mass.

### Dough

0. Combine milk, water, and yeast, and stir till homogeneous.
0. Add all other ingredients and knead until the dough is firm
   and doesn't stick.
   Add more flour if necessary.
0. Cover the dough and leave it to raise in a warm place for 15 minutes.
0. Divide the dough in 4 pieces of even size.
0. One by one, roll the pieces into flat rectangles of 20 x 30 cm (W x L)
   with a rolling pin.
   The length is suggested but should fit on a baking tray.
0. Smear an even layer of remonce on each rectangle.
0. Roll the rectangles tightly into Swiss rolls.
0. Place the rolls on baking trays covered with parchment paper.
0. Flatten the rolls with your hand.
0. Cut several deep rifts, evenly spaced, in each roll
   to reveal the remonce.
0. Cover the rolls and leave to raise for 40 minutes.
0. Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C (200&deg;C convection).
0. Brush the rolls with egg wash.
0. Bake each roll for 10 to 15 minutes; better too little than too much.
0. When the kanelstænger have cooled, cover them in white frosting.
